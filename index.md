# Welcome to Byron Laferriere's personal ePortfolio

This is the Capstone course for my Computer Science degree from Southern New Hampshire University. For this project, we are asked to go back and re-work three projects
that we previously completed and make enhancements to them that align with the class objectives and outcomes. The first thing we needed to do was conduct a code review,
to begin practicing what is done in many professional settings. Although this is usually performed in front of others, this was a personal and less formal code review performed
in private, to help us begin practicing how to articulate our actions and highlight the skills obtained/highlighted in doing so.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/byronlaferriere/byronlaferriere.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
